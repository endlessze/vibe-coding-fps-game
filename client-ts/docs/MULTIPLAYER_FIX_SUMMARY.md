# Multiplayer Game Framework - Fix Summary

## Recent Critical Bug Fixes (Latest)

### üéØ Demon Death Synchronization Fix

**Issue**: In multiplayer mode, when P1 kills a demon:

- Demon disappears from P1's radar ‚úÖ
- Demon model undergoes death transformation but doesn't disappear from P1's screen ‚ùå
- Demon on P2's screen is not synchronized to be cleared ‚ùå
- Demon doesn't disappear from P2's radar ‚ùå

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Incomplete demon removal**: Demons were marked as dead but not properly removed from scene and tracking arrays
2. **Event synchronization mismatch**: Death events weren't being handled consistently across all clients
3. **Radar filtering issues**: Dead demons continued to show on radar due to improper filtering logic
4. **Race conditions**: Local death state wasn't being applied immediately for visual feedback

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced NetworkManager.handleServerDemonDeath()**:

   - Added proper null checks for demon.userData
   - Immediate marking of demons as dead/removed to hide from radar
   - Proper removal from both scene and demons array
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **Improved Game.onDemonHit() for Network Demons**:

   - Immediate local death state application for visual feedback
   - Proper marking with isDead, markedForRemoval, and serverHealth = 0
   - Local death effects for immediate player feedback
   - Maintained server synchronization via sendDemonDeath()

3. **Enhanced Radar Filtering Logic**:

   - Added comprehensive dead demon filtering in UIManager.drawDemonsOnRadar()
   - Multiple safety checks: isDead, markedForRemoval, serverHealth <= 0
   - Prevents dead demons from appearing on any player's radar

4. **Improved Network Demon Cleanup**:

   - Added Game.removeNetworkDemonById() method for precise demon removal
   - Enhanced update loop to immediately clean up dead network demons
   - Better synchronization between scene removal and array cleanup

5. **Enhanced Event Debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging for demon death events
   - Better error reporting for missing demons
   - Clearer event data structure logging

**Technical Details**:

- **Event**: `world:demon:death` (matches server expectation)
- **Server Response**: Contains `{demonId, killerId, killerName, position}`
- **Client Handling**: Immediate local state update + server synchronization
- **Radar Update**: Real-time filtering of dead demons
- **Scene Management**: Immediate removal from THREE.js scene

**Testing Verification**:

- ‚úÖ P1 kills demon ‚Üí demon immediately disappears from P1's radar and screen
- ‚úÖ P2 receives death event ‚Üí demon disappears from P2's radar and screen
- ‚úÖ Kill count updates correctly for the killing player
- ‚úÖ Death effects play for all players
- ‚úÖ No "ghost demons" remain in scene or tracking arrays
