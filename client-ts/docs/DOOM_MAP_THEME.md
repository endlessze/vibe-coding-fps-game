### üó∫Ô∏è **Map Layout**

The map is organized around a central courtyard with branching areas:

```
    [North Rooms]
         |
    [North Corridor] ‚Üê [Zigzag Hall]
         |
[West Complex] ‚Üê [Courtyard] ‚Üí [Secret Area]
    |              |
[Exit Area]    [Start Room]
    |
[Boss Chamber]
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

#### **Room Generation**
```typescript
private createRoom(id: string, position: Vector3, size: Vector3, type: RoomType): void {
  // Floor creation with elevation support
  // Wall generation (4 walls per room)
  // Room-specific lighting
  // Special features based on room type
}
```

#### **Hallway System**
```typescript
private createHallway(start: Vector3, end: Vector3, width: number, height: number): void {
  // Calculate length and direction
  // Create floor plane with proper orientation
  // Generate parallel walls
  // Add connecting lighting
}
```

#### **Collision System Integration**
All walls, objects, and interactive elements are registered with the collision system:
```typescript
this.addCollidableObject(wall, "static");
this.addCollidableObject(terminal, "interactive");
```

### üéÆ **Usage**

#### **Theme Selection**
```typescript
import { SceneManager } from './core/SceneManager';

const sceneManager = SceneManager.getInstance();
await sceneManager.initialize('doomMap');
```

#### **Testing**
Use the test file at `client-ts/public/tests/doom-map-test.html` to:
- Explore the 3D map with WASD + Mouse controls
- Navigate between rooms using quick-travel buttons
- View the minimap showing room layout
- Toggle wireframe mode to see the structure
- Get room information and connections

### üîß **Configuration**

The theme uses these configuration values:

```typescript
const config: SceneThemeConfig = {
  name: "Doom Map",
  primaryColor: 0x2a2a2a,      // Dark gray concrete
  secondaryColor: 0x4a4a4a,    // Lighter gray walls
  fogColor: 0x1a1a1a,          // Dark fog
  ambientLightColor: 0x404040, // Low ambient light
  directionalLightColor: 0x808080, // Main lighting
  groundColor: 0x333333,       // Dark concrete floor
  skyColor: 0x0a0a0a,         // Very dark sky
  glowColor: 0x00ff00,        // Green for terminals
  accentColor: 0xff4400,      // Orange/red for danger
};
```

### üìê **Dimensions**

- **Map Scale**: 2.5x multiplier from 2D to 3D
- **Wall Height**: 8 units (standard), 12 units (boss chamber)
- **Door Dimensions**: 3 units wide, 6 units high
- **Boundary Size**: 90 units total playable area
- **Room Elevations**: -1 to +2 units variation

### üé® **Visual Effects**

#### **Ground Details**
- **Floor Textures**: Varied concrete patterns
- **Scuff Marks**: Battle damage indicators
- **Metal Grating**: Industrial areas
- **Room-Specific Flooring**: Different colors for different room types

#### **Atmospheric Elements**
- **Particle System**: Subtle dust/debris particles
- **Fog System**: Distance-based atmospheric fog
- **Shadow Mapping**: PCF soft shadows for all objects
- **Glow Effects**: Terminal screens and special objects

### üöÄ **Performance Considerations**

- **LOD System**: Objects are culled at distance
- **Efficient Geometry**: Minimal polygon count while maintaining detail
- **Texture Optimization**: Shared materials where possible
- **Shadow Optimization**: 2048x2048 shadow maps for quality/performance balance

### üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements for the Doom map theme:

1. **Animated Elements**: Moving platforms, rotating doors
2. **Sound Integration**: Positional audio for different rooms
3. **Dynamic Lighting**: Flickering lights, emergency lighting
4. **Interactive Doors**: Proper door opening/closing mechanics
5. **Multiple Map Variants**: Different classic Doom levels
6. **Texture Mapping**: Authentic Doom wall textures
7. **Ceiling Details**: Varied ceiling heights and designs

### üìù **Notes**

- The theme extends `BaseSceneTheme` for consistency with other themes
- All objects are properly integrated with the collision system
- Room data is stored in a Map for efficient lookup
- Hallway generation uses vector mathematics for proper orientation
- The design prioritizes authenticity to the original Doom aesthetic while leveraging modern 3D capabilities

This implementation successfully transforms the classic 2D Doom map schematic into an immersive 3D environment that maintains the spirit and layout of the original while adding modern visual enhancements.
