# Demon Kill Synchronization Fix

## Issue Summary

The demon kill events were being sent correctly from client to server, but the server was not properly removing killed demons from its state, causing synchronization issues and memory leaks.

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Server-side Demon Persistence**

- ❌ Server marked demons as `isAlive = false` but never removed them from `room.gameState.demons` map
- ❌ Dead demons continued to consume memory and potentially interfere with AI processing
- ❌ This could cause inconsistencies in demon counts and wave progression

### 2. **Inadequate Cleanup on Room Destruction**

- ❌ Not all room deletion points were calling `stopDemonAI()` to clean up AI intervals
- ❌ Could lead to memory leaks with orphaned intervals continuing to run

### 3. **Limited Debugging Information**

- ❌ Insufficient logging to track demon kill events through the entire pipeline

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Server-side Demon Removal**

**File:** `server/src/index.ts` - Demon death handler

```typescript
// OLD: Only marked as dead
demon.isAlive = false;

// NEW: Actually remove from demons map
demon.isAlive = false; // Prevent duplicate kills
room.gameState.demons.delete(payload.demonId); // Actually remove
console.log(`💀 Removed demon ${payload.demonId} from server state`);
```

### 2. **Enhanced Wave Completion Cleanup**

**File:** `server/src/index.ts` - Wave complete handler

```typescript
// Clear the AI interval to stop processing demons
if (room.gameState.aiInterval) {
  clearInterval(room.gameState.aiInterval);
  room.gameState.aiInterval = undefined;
}

// Clear any remaining demons from the server state (cleanup)
const remainingDemons = room.gameState.demons.size;
if (remainingDemons > 0) {
  console.log(`🧹 Cleaning up ${remainingDemons} remaining demons`);
  room.gameState.demons.clear();
}
```

### 3. **Complete Room Cleanup**

**File:** `server/src/index.ts` - Disconnect and cleanup handlers

```typescript
// Added stopDemonAI() calls to all room deletion points:
// 1. When player leaves and room becomes empty
// 2. When player disconnects and room becomes empty
// 3. During periodic cleanup of expired rooms
```

### 4. **Enhanced Client Logging**

**File:** `client-ts/src/core/Game.ts` - Demon hit handler

```typescript
console.log(
  `🎯 Sending demon death to server: ${demonId} (type: ${networkDemon.userData.demonType})`
);
```

## Event Flow Verification

### Correct Flow:

1. **Client hits demon** → `onDemonHit()` called with correct `serverId`
2. **Client sends death** → `networkManager.sendDemonDeath(serverId)`
3. **Server receives** → `world:demon:death` event with correct `demonId`
4. **Server processes** → Updates stats, removes demon, broadcasts to all players
5. **All clients receive** → `world:demon:death` event, remove demon from local state
6. **Wave completion** → Server cleans up AI intervals and remaining demons

### Key Improvements:

- ✅ Demons are actually removed from server memory
- ✅ AI intervals are properly cleaned up
- ✅ Wave completion properly resets demon state
- ✅ Room destruction cleans up all resources
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Demon kills are properly synchronized between all players
- [ ] Server memory doesn't accumulate dead demons
- [ ] Wave progression works correctly
- [ ] Room cleanup doesn't leave orphaned intervals
- [ ] Multiple players can kill demons without conflicts
- [ ] Console logs show proper demon removal flow
