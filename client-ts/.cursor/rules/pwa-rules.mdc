0: Ensure exclusive use of English in this game project, encompassing UI, documentation, all messages, and all logs.
1: Always maintain the maintainability of the project structure, avoiding issues such as excessively large single code files.
2: Strive to fundamentally solve logical problems, avoiding the use of temporary and hack methods to solve problems.
3: Strive to use the most concise logic and code to achieve the best results.
4: Avoid large-scale refactoring, and if necessary, perform small-scale refactoring step by step to optimize the overall structure.
5: For both single and multiplayer modes, we should strive to handle methods and data structures as uniformly as possible, avoiding the use of special handling methods under different methods to cause additional logical complexity.
6: Currently, the server-side code is simple but works correctly. We should prioritize the migration of all completed functions from the old @/client to the current new version of @/client-ts, temporarily avoiding changes to the server-side code. After the migration is completed, we will continue to iterate on the server-side logic.
