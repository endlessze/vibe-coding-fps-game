🥤
initiate the game with a vibe coding FPS framework ( html + threejs )

💻
During the process, we tested multiple coding models and agents, but currently, only Claude 4 seems capable of handling the current development tasks. Therefore, all subsequent prompts will default to using this model to complete the work.

🌍
We plan to let AI complete 100% of the code, and all scenes and models will also be designed by AI. We may consider using models like hunyuan world for text to 3D world to create some scenes in the future, but they are not perfect yet, so we are not introducing them for now.

🏖
In fact, using an AI Agent for development does not speed up the pace of professional developers, but rather slows it down by about 20% compared to manual coding. However, the difference lies in that when AI can complete all coding work, human engineers can take a break during the coding period to drink a cup of coffee or tea, and think about and design the next step of work. This working rhythm can make engineers more focused on upper-level design and overall control.
