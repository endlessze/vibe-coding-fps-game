node test-runner.js
```

### 2. Development Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (fast)
npm run test:unit

# Watch mode (during development)
npm run test:watch
```

### 3. Complete Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### 4. Real Server Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## 📈 Test Results Example

```
✅ Dependencies: Installed

✅ Unit Tests: Passing (9/9)
✅ Server: Functional
✅ WebSocket: Working
✅ Room Management: Tested
✅ Chat System: Verified
✅ Game Flow: Functional
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeout**

   - Increase Jest timeout settings
   - Check network connection
   - Ensure no other services are using the port

2. **Module Import Errors**

   - Ensure `esModuleInterop: true` is in tsconfig.json
   - Check dependencies are correctly installed

3. **WebSocket Connection Failure**
   - Ensure server port is available
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify CORS configuration

### Debugging Tips

```bash
# Verbose test output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/helpers.test.ts

# Detect memory leaks
npm test -- --detectOpenHandles
```

## 📝 Development Recommendations

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing test structure
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Ensure resource cleanup (disconnect connections, etc.)
4. Add appropriate timeout settings

### Performance Testing

- Start with small scale (10 connections)
- Gradually increase load
- Monitor memory usage
- Test various network conditions

### Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and functional stability.
